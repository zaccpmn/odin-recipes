        <h4>Delicious, quick and easy Cajun pasta dish.</h4>
        <br>
        <p>It’s been a while since I’ve made a one-pot pasta! But this weekend I got a craving for a creamy, smoky, spicy, easy one pot dish, so I set to work! This One Pot Creamy Cajun Chicken Pasta is incredibly easy to make, so it’s <em>perfect</em> for weeknight dinners. I have a few variations for you below (spicy, non-spicy, creamy, non-creamy) so <strong>be sure to read on!</strong></p>
        <br>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>2tbsp Cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>1tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1lb chicken breast</li>
            <li>1/2lb penne pasta(uncooked)</li>
            <li>15 .oz fire roasted diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 .oz cream cheese</li>
            <li>3 red onions, sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the ingredients for the Cajun seasoning in a small bowl. Cut the chicken into 1/2 to 3/4-inch cubes. Place the cubed chicken in a bowl, pour the Cajun seasoning over top, and stir to coat the chicken in spices.</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil and butter to a large deep skillet. Heat the oil and butter over medium-high until the skillet is very hot and the butter is melted and foamy. Add the seasoned chicken to the skillet and cook for a couple minutes on each side, or just until the outside gets some color. The chicken does not need to be cooked through at this point.</li>
            <li>Add the diced yellow onion to the skillet and continue to sauté for about 2 minutes more, or just until the onion begins to soften. Allow the moisture from the onion to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
            <li>Next, add the pasta, fire roasted diced tomatoes (with the juices), and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir just until everything is evenly combined, then place a lid on top and allow the broth to come up to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the pasta simmer for about ten minutes, stirring every couple of minutes, until the pasta is tender and the liquid is thick and saucy.</li>
            <li>Add the cream cheese to the skillet in chunks, then stir until it has melted into the sauce. Top the pasta with sliced red onions and serve.</li>
        </ol>
